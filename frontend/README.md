# Remember this ...
- Remove unnecessary code and files.
- Initialize git in main directory.
- Add `images` in public folder.
- Create components in `src/components` folder and import in `App.js`. (Names should be in Title Case)
- Create screens in `src/screens` folder and import in `App.js`. (Names should be in Title Case)


# Building This Project
1. Create a react project.
2. Remove unnecessary code and files. (Test files, logos, svgs)
2. Create components and import in "App.js"
3. Use `Bootswatch LUX Theme` and import in index.js as `import './bootstrap.min.css'`
4. Create screens as pages.
5. Used `react-router-dom` and `react-router-bootstrap` for routing the pages such that there no loading/reloading.
